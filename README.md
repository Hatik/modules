#Application to get weather, currencies or news


Index page is at the root url with some basic UI, in my case:
http://localhost:8080/

To get the information in json for other usage following urls are available: 
1. /weather - getting information directly received from accuweather API
2. /weather/v2 - getting information received from accuweather API and parsed to POJO's
3. /currency -  getting current currency rates from cbr.ru
